                            (FICS) located at the University of Florida.  My
                            research focuses predominantly on the security of the
                            human voice in modern systems.  However, I am also
                            interested in the application of digital signal
                            processing, big data techniques, and explainable
                            Machine Learning to improve security across various

                                    Generative machine learning models have
                                    made convincing voice synthesis a reality.
                                    While such tools can be extremely useful in
                                    applications where people consent to their
                                    voices being cloned (e.g., patients losing
                                    the ability to speak, actors not wanting to
                                    have to redo dialog, etc), they also allow
                                    for the creation of nonconsensual content
                                    known as deepfakes. This malicious audio is
                                    problematic not only because it can
                                    convincingly be used to impersonate
                                    arbitrary users, but because detecting
                                    deepfakes is challenging and generally
                                    requires knowledge of the specific deepfake
                                    generator. In this paper, we develop a new
                                    mechanism for detecting audio deepfakes
                                    using techniques from the field of
                                    articulatory phonetics.  Specifically, we
                                    apply fluid dynamics to estimate the
                                    arrangement of the human vocal tract during
                                    speech generation and show that deepfakes
                                    often model impossible or highly-unlikely
                                    anatomical arrangements.  When
                                    parameterized to achieve 99.9% precision,
                                    our detection mechanism achieves a recall
                                    of 99.5%, correctly identifying all but
                                    one deepfake sample in our dataset. We then
                                    discuss the limitations of this approach,
                                    and how deepfake models fail to reproduce
                                    all aspects of speech equally. In so doing,
                                    we demonstrate that subtle, but
                                    biologically constrained aspects of how
                                    humans generate speech are not captured by
                                    current models, and can therefore act as a
                                    powerful tool to detect audio deepfakes.

                                    Smart speakers are increasingly appearing
                                    in homes, enterprises, and businesses
                                    including hotels. These systems serve as
                                    hubs for other IoT devices and deliver
                                    content from streaming media services.
                                    However, such an arrangement creates a
                                    number of security concerns. For instance,
                                    providing such devices with long-term 
                                    secrets is problematic with regards to
                                    vulnerable devices and fails to capture the
                                    increasingly transient nature of the
                                    relationship between users and the
                                    devices (e.g., in hotel or airbnb settings,
                                    this device is not owned by the customer
                                    and may only be used for a single day).
                                    Moreover, the limited interfaces available
                                    to such speakers make entering such
                                    credentials in a safe manner difficult. We
                                    address these problems with Lux, a system
                                    to provide ephemeral, fine-grained
                                    authorization to smart speakers which can
                                    be automatically revoked when the user
                                    and hub are no longer in the same location.
                                    We develop protocols using the LED/light
                                    channel available to many smart speaker
                                    devices to help users properly identify the
                                    device with which they are communicating,
                                    and demonstrate through a formally
                                    validated protocol that such authorization
                                    takes only a few seconds in practice.
                                    Through this effort, we demonstrate that
                                    Lux can safely authorize devices to access
                                    user accounts while limiting any long-term
                                    exposure to compromise.

                                    identification systems are being deployed
                                    in a wide array of applications, from
                                    providing control mechanisms to devices
                                    lacking traditional interfaces, to the
                                    automatic transcription of conversations
                                    and authentication of users. Many of these
                                    applications have significant security and
                                    privacy considerations. We develop attacks
                                    that force mistranscription and
                                    misidentification in state of the art
                                    systems, with minimal impact on human
                                    comprehension. Processing pipelines for
                                    modern systems are comprised of signal
                                    preprocessing and feature extraction steps,
                                    whose output is fed to a machine-learned
                                    model. Prior work has focused on the
                                    models, using white-box knowledge to tailor
                                    model-specific attacks. We focus on the
                                    pipeline stages before the models, which
                                    (unlike the models) are quite similar
                                    across systems. As such, our attacks are
                                    black-box and transferable, and
                                    demonstrably achieve mistranscription and
                                    misidentification rates as high as 100% by
                                    modifying only a few frames of audio. We
                                    perform a study via Amazon Mechanical Turk
                                    demonstrating that there is no
                                    statistically significant difference
                                    between human perception of regular and
                                    perturbed audio. Our findings suggest that
                                    models may learn aspects of speech that are
                                    generally not perceived by human subjects,
                                    but that are crucial for model accuracy. We
                                    also find that certain English language
                                    phonemes (in particular, vowels) are
                                    significantly more susceptible to our
                                    attack. We show that the attacks are
                                    effective when mounted over cellular
                                    networks, where signals are subject to
                                    degradation due to transcoding, jitter, and
                                    packet loss.

                                    <p> Modern Hospital networks are similar to
                                    other corporate networks architecturally
                                    speaking. However, these kinds of networks
                                    are fundamentally different because of
                                    their interaction with medical data.  Due
                                    to regulatory requirements for things like
                                    HIPPA, hospital networks are difficult to
                                    measure and catalog. In this paper, we
                                    conducted an ethical security analysis of
                                    an active hospital's internal network. </p>

                                    <p> Modern hospital systems are complex
                                    environments that rely on high
                                    interconnectivity with the larger Internet.
                                    With this connectivity comes a vast attack
                                    surface. Security researchers have expended
                                    considerable effort to characterize the
                                    risks posed to medical devices (e.g.,
                                    pacemakers and insulin pumps). However,
                                    there has been no systematic,
                                    ecosystem-wide analyses of a modern
                                    hospital system to date, perhaps due to the
                                    challenges of collecting and analyzing
                                    sensitive healthcare data. Hospital traffic
                                    requires special considerations because
                                    healthcare data may contain private
                                    information or may come from
                                    safety-critical devices in charge of
                                    patient care. We describe the process of
                                    obtaining the network data in a safe and
                                    ethical manner in order to help expand
                                    future research in this field. We present
                                    an analysis of network-enabled devices
                                    connected to the hospital used for its
                                    daily operations without posing any harm to
                                    the hospital’s environment. We perform a
                                    Digital Healthcare-Associated Infection
                                    (D-HAI) analysis of the hospital ecosystem,
                                    assessing a major multi-campus healthcare
                                    system over a period of six months. As part
                                    of the D-HAI analysis, we characterize DNS
                                    requests and TLS/SSL communications to
                                    better understand the threats faced within
                                    the hospital environment without disturbing
                                    the operational network. Contrary to past
                                    assumptions, we find that medical devices
                                    have minimal exposure to the external
                                    Internet, but that medical support devices
                                    (e.g., servers, computer terminals)
                                    essential for daily hospital operations are
                                    much more exposed. While much of this
                                    communication appears to be benign, we
                                    discover evidence of insecure and broken
                                    cryptography and misconfigured devices, and
                                    potential botnet activity. Analyzing the
                                    network ecosystem in which they operate
                                    gives us an insight into the weaknesses and
                                    misconfigurations hospitals need to address
                                    to ensure the safety and privacy of
                                    patients.

                                    <p> Recent years have seen the Short
                                    Message Service (SMS) become a critical
                                    component of the security infrastructure,
                                    assisting with tasks including identity
                                    verification and second-factor
                                    authentication. At the same time, this
                                    messaging infrastructure has become
                                    dramatically more open and connected to
                                    public networks than ever before.
                                    However, the implications of this openness,

                                    are not well understood. In this article,
                                    we provide a comprehensive longitudinal
                                    study to answer these questions, analyzing
                                    over 900,000 text messages sent to public
                                    online SMS gateways over the course of 28
                                    months.  From this data, we uncover the
                                    geographical distribution of spam
                                    messages, study SMS as a transmission
                                    medium of malicious content, and find that
                                    changes in benign and malicious behaviors
                                    in the SMS ecosystem have been minimal
                                    during our collection period. The key

                                    and demonstrates that such evasion will

                                    Interestingly enough, the same thing
                                    happens if you replace your TV in your

                                they instead instruct the device to unlock your

                                It really doesn't matter. The point is, why can
                                electronic speakers trigger your voice
                                activated devices. The fact that this can
                                happen is a security risk and the topic of our
                                work at Wisec '18. Our work is able to
                                differentiating between voice commands
                                originating from humans and electronic speakers
                                in order to prevent this sort of electronic

                                    <p> Voice interfaces are increasingly
                                    becoming integrated into a variety of
                                    Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Such
                                    systems can dramatically simplify
                                    interactions between users and devices with
                                    limited displays. Unfortunately, voice
                                    interfaces also create new opportunities
                                    for exploitation. Specifically, any
                                    sound-emitting device within range of the
                                    system implementing the voice interface
                                    (e.g., a smart television, an
                                    Internet-connected appliance, etc) can
                                    potentially cause these systems to perform
                                    operations against the desires of their
                                    owners (e.g., unlock doors, make
                                    unauthorized purchases, etc).  We address
                                    this problem by developing a technique to
                                    recognize fundamental differences in audio
                                    created by humans and electronic speakers.
                                    We identify sub-bass over-excitation, or
                                    the presence of significant low frequency
                                    signals that are outside of the range of
                                    human voices but inherent to the design of
                                    modern speakers, as a strong differentiator
                                    between these two sources. After
                                    identifying this phenomenon, we demonstrate
                                    its use in preventing adversarial requests,
                                    replayed audio, and hidden commands with a
                                    100%/1.72% TPR/FPR in quiet environments.
                                    In so doing, we demonstrate that commands
                                    injected via nearby audio devices can be
                                    effectively removed by voice interfaces.

                                    that, these devices are able to do more
                                    things than ever before. Everything from

                                    <p> Voice controlled interfaces have vastly
                                    improved the usability of many devices
                                    (e.g., headless IoT systems).
                                    Unfortunately, the lack of authentication
                                    for these interfaces has also introduced
                                    command injection vulnerabilities - whether
                                    via compromised IoT devices, television ads
                                    or simply malicious nearby neighbors,
                                    causing such devices to perform
                                    unauthenticated sensitive commands is
                                    relatively easy. We address these
                                    weaknesses with Two Microphone
                                    Authentication (2MA), which takes advantage
                                    of the presence of multiple ambient and
                                    personal devices operating in the same
                                    area.  We develop an embodiment of 2MA that
                                    combines approximate localization through
                                    Direction of Arrival (DOA) techniques with
                                    Robust Audio Hashes (RSHs). Our results
                                    show that our 2MA system can localize a
                                    source to within a narrow physical cone
                                    (<30&deg) with zero false positives, eliminate
                                              replay attacks and prevent the
                                              injection of inaudible/hidden
                                              commands. As such, we
                                              dramatically increase the
                                              difficulty for an adversary to
                                              carry out such attacks and

                                              effective means of authenticating
                                              and localizing voice commands.

                                    Phones are used to confirm some of our most
                                    sensitive transactions. From coordination
                                    between energy providers in the power grid
                                    to corroboration of high-value transfers
                                    with a financial institution, we rely on
                                    telephony to serve as a trustworthy
                                    communications path. However, such trust is
                                    not well placed given the widespread
                                    understanding of telephony’s inability to
                                    provide end-to-end authentication between
                                    callers. In this paper, we address this
                                    problem through the AuthentiCall system.
                                    AuthentiCall not only cryptographically
                                    authenticates both parties on the call, but
                                    also provides strong guarantees of the
                                    integrity of conversations made over
                                    traditional phone networks. We achieve
                                    these ends through the use of formally
                                    verified protocols that bind low-bitrate
                                    data channels to heterogeneous audio
                                    channels. Unlike previous efforts, we

                                    to provide strong authentication before
                                    calls are answered, allowing users to
                                    ignore calls claiming a particular Caller
                                    ID that are unable or unwilling to provide
                                    proof of that assertion. Moreover, we
                                    detect 99% of tampered call audio with
                                    negligible false positives and only a
                                    worst-case 1.4 second call establishment
                                    overhead. In so doing, we argue that strong
                                    and efficient end-to-end authentication for
                                    phone networks is approaching a practical
                                    reality.

                                    <!-- <p>The invention of the telephone
                                    revolutionized how people communicated over
                                    a century ago. Despite this, 140 years
                                    later the government of the United States
                                    of America can only communicate directly
                                    with its citizens over physical mail! The
                                    preposterousness of this fact is only
                                    overshadowed by the severity of the problem
                                    it highlights. You may be asking yourself
                                    why this is the case.  Simply put, caller
                                    ID is essentially meaningless today.
                                    Attackers can claim ANY number or ID they
                                    wish ("Hello this is... Steve... from the
                                    IRS"). In our paper at Usenix '16 we
                                    discuss the first ever protocol that
                                    provide strong authentication to a claimed
                                    identity (caller ID) for a phone call in
                                    the modern telephony network.</p> -->

                                    Telephones remain a trusted platform for
                                    conducting some of our most sensitive
                                    exchanges. From banking to taxes, wide
                                    swathes of industry and government rely on
                                    telephony as a secure fall-back when
                                    attempting to confirm the veracity of a
                                    transaction. In spite of this,
                                    authentication is poorly managed between
                                    these systems, and in the general case it
                                    is impossible to be certain of the identity
                                    (i.e., Caller ID) of the entity at the
                                    other end of a call.  We address this
                                    problem with AuthLoop, the first system to
                                    provide cryptographic authentication solely
                                    within the voice channel. We design,
                                    implement and characterize the performance
                                    of an in-band modem for executing a
                                    TLS-inspired authentication protocol, and
                                    demonstrate its abilities to ensure that
                                    the explicit single-sided authentication
                                    procedures pervading the web are also
                                    possible on all phones. We show
                                    experimentally that this protocol can be
                                    executed with minimal computational
                                    overhead and only a few seconds of user
                                    time (≈9 instead of ≈97 seconds for a
                                    naıve implementation of TLS 1.2) over
                                    heterogeneous networks. In so doing, we
                                    demonstrate that strong end-to-end
                                    validation of Caller ID is indeed practical
                                    for all telephony networks.

                                    messages, etc. Oddly enough, most people
                                    never really experience too much spam text

                                    Text messaging is used by more people

                                    presents a desirable medium for spammers.
                                    While this problem has been studied by
                                    many researchers over the years, the recent
                                    increase in legitimate bulk traffic (e.g.,
                                    account verification, 2FA, etc.) has
                                    dramatically changed the mix of traffic
                                    seen in this space, reducing the

                                    classification efforts. This paper
                                    demonstrates the performance degradation of
                                    those detectors when used on a large-scale
                                    corpus of text messages containing both
                                    bulk and spam messages. Against our labeled

                                    months, the precision and recall of past
                                    classifiers fall to 23.8% and 61.3%
                                    respectively. However, using our

                                    clusters, precision and recall rise to 100%
                                    and 96.8%. We not only show that our
                                    collected dataset helps to correct many of
                                    the overtraining errors seen in previous
                                    studies, but also present insights into a

                                    received/sent roughly 32 texts per day.  If
                                    you were like me and in college at the
                                    time, that number was probably closer to
                                    ~130 a day. That's over 4,000 texts a
                                    months, so it should go without saying that
                                    texting has become one of the largest forms
                                    of communication to ever exist on this

                                    talking to your friends and family, oh no.
                                    Companies like Google will use it to send
                                    2FA (2 factor authentication) codes, less

                                    phone number as a way to geographically
                                    estimate where you are (if you have a US
                                    number you clearly must be an American or
                                    at least living there, right?). Well, we
                                    found a bunch of really interesting sites
                                    that actually buy phone numbers around the
                                    world, and then post all incoming text
                                    messages to a website. Sounds like some
                                    neat data to me! So in our IEEE S&P '16

                                    Service (SMS) have revolutionized
                                    interpersonal communication. Recent years
                                    have also seen this service become a
                                    critical component of the security
                                    infrastructure, assisting with tasks
                                    including identity verification and
                                    second-factor authentication. At the same
                                    time, this messaging infrastructure has
                                    become dramatically more open and connected
                                    to public networks than ever before.
                                    However, the implications of this openness,
                                    the security practices of benign services,
                                    and the malicious misuse of this ecosystem
                                    are not well understood. In this paper, we
                                    provide the first longitudinal study to
                                    answer these questions, analyzing nearly
                                    400,000 text messages sent to public online
                                    SMS gateways over the course of 14 months.
                                    From this data, we are able to identify not
                                    only a range of services sending extremely
                                    sensitive plaintext data and implementing
                                    low entropy solutions for one-use codes,
                                    but also offer insights into the prevalence
                                    of SMS spam and behaviors indicating that
                                    public gateways are primarily used for
                                    evading account creation policies that
                                    require verified phone numbers. This latter
                                    finding has significant implications for
                                    research combatting phone-verified account
                                    fraud and demonstrates that such evasion
                                    will continue to be difficult to detect and
                                    prevent.
